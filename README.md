## Overview

The **Covid Portfolio Project** leverages SQL to perform in-depth analysis of COVID-19 data. It includes queries to explore different facets of the pandemic, such as confirmed cases, recoveries, deaths, and trends over time and across regions. The project is ideal for those interested in data analysis and SQL-based data manipulation.

## Features

- Analysis of COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths.
- Regional and temporal breakdown of COVID-19 data.
- Aggregation and summarization of data for key insights.
- Visualization-friendly query outputs for generating reports and dashboards.

## Dataset

The project uses a publicly available dataset containing information about COVID-19 cases, recoveries, deaths, and other relevant attributes. Ensure the dataset is imported into your SQL environment before running the analysis scripts.

## SQL Scripts

The project contains the following SQL scripts:

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Scripts to clean and preprocess raw COVID-19 data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: SQL queries to explore the dataset and understand key patterns.
- **Trend Analysis**: Queries to identify trends over time (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly cases).
- **Regional Analysis**: Scripts to analyze COVID-19 impact across different regions and countries.
- **Summary Statistics**: Queries to generate summary statistics and aggregated results.
